Examining the bar count plot of Booking Months, we can make the following deductions:

Highest occupancy is October (10)
Highest occupancy month range is June (6) thru October (10), with a small decline occurring in July (7)
Peak booking months are August (8) thru October(10)
Lowest occupancy is in January (1)
Lowest occupancy month range is November (11) thru April (5)
January (1) and February (2) are the slowest months
There is a notable increase in April (4) from March (3)  Is this due to school vacations?
Its unclear why there would be a drop off between June (6) and July (7). **We are only examining 2 months of data. It would be interesting to see if additional years of data would show a consistent trend

Dividing the Booking Months into Busy and Quiet seasons:

Highest occupancy is October (10)
Highest occupancy month range is June (6) thru October (10), with a small decline occurring in July (7)
Peak booking months are August (8) thru October(10)
Lowest occupancy is in January (1)
Lowest occupancy month range is November (11) thru April (5)
There is a notable increase in April (4) from March (3). Is this due to school vacations?
Its unclear why there would be a drop off between June (6) and July (7). **We are only examining 2 months of data. It would be interesting to see if additional years of data would show a consistent trend

Dividing the Booking Months into Peak and Other seasons:

The peak booking season occurs between August (8) and October (10)
Those 3 months (August – October) account for almost 40% of the years bookings.

Examining the histogram of booking market segments, we can make the following observations:

Highest market segment type is Online
2nd highest is Offline 
Corporate ranks a distance 3rd 
Aviation and Complementary are almost negligible
Complementary is free rooms. Unless it can be verified that comped rooms lead to future bookings, it would be advisable to keep this number low

Examining Market Segment percentages relative to overall bookings:

Online booking is by far the strongest market segment
Offline still accounts for around 30% of all bookings
Corporate ranks a distance 3rd 
Aviation accounts for less than 1% of the bookings

Examining Number of Guests we see:

The number of Adult Guests is Normal Distribution
Most rooms (72%) have 2 adults
25% of rooms have a single adult occupant
The number of Children is Left-Skew Distribution
A surprisingly number of rooms have no children (93%)

Examining Booking Lead Times we see:

The Booking Lead Time data has a definite right skewed distribution 
A majority of the bookings occur 100 days or less ahead of the customer’s arrival

Examining Number of Days Booked we see:

The Weekday Bookings plot looks like Normal Distribution with a Right-Skew
The Weekend Bookings looks like a Right-Skew Distribution
Zero (0)days booked indicate the customer booked only weekdays or weekends for their stay
Most of the bookings had at least 1 weekday night included
Roughly ½ the bookings had 2 weekend nights

Examining Total Number of Days Booked we see:

The total number of Bookings plot looks like Normal Distribution with a Right-Skew
The Weekend Bookings looks like a Right-Skew Distribution
Few clients book more than 7 days
Zero (0)days booked looks like it could be a data error
Most of the bookings had at least 1 weekday night included

Examining Total Number of Days Booked we see:

By binning the data, we get a slightly different view
This looks much more like a normal distribution
From this, we can see that almost 80% of the bookins are for between 2 and 7 nights

Examining Booking Lead Times we see:

The Booking Lead Time data has a definite right skewed distribution 
A majority of the bookings occur 100 days or less ahead of the customer’s arrival

Examining Previous Cancellations continued:

Binning and plotting the percentages of the Booking Lead Time data reiterates the right skewed distribution
2/3rds of clients book within 100 days of their arrival date
A small percentage (11%) book more than 200 days in advance


EExamining Booking Lead Times continued:

Binning and plotting the percentages of the Booking Lead Time data reiterates the right skewed distribution
2/3rds of clients book within 100 days of their arrival date
A small percentage (11%) book more than 200 days in advance

Examining Previous Cancellations continued:

Binning and plotting the percentages of the Booking Lead Time data reiterates the right skewed distribution
2/3rds of clients book within 100 days of their arrival date
A small percentage (11%) book more than 200 days in advance

Examining Previous Cancellations continued:

Looking at the supplied matrix data, it appears that Previous Cancellations are minimal, especially when comparing against the number of clients that did not have Previous Cancellations

Examining the histogram of repeat customer business, we can deduce the following:

Most of the customers at this hotel are 1st time bookings
There is very little (almost negligble) repeat business
This might indicate that the hotel is good at drawing initial clients but poor at following through by reaching out to previous customers
This also might speak to the level of quality of stay and service as when customers have a less than positive experience, they are not likely to rebook in the future
Its unclear to what degree guests having a potentially negative experience affects the bookings initialized by word of mouth

Examining Repeat Customers percentages relative to overall bookings:

Roughly 98% of the bookings are from new customers
Repeat customers make up less than 3% of the bookings
Those are incredibly skewed results in favor of 1st time clients
This is especially alarming for an industry where reputation (from word of mouth, online reviews) is important in sustaining a profitable business
The hotel really has to take a step back and examine it’s operations, cultural enviornment and guest experience

Examining remaining features:

Room Type generally looks like a right-skewed distribution
Most people book either Room Type 1 (79%) or Room Type 4 (16%)
Parking Requirements -  Almost all clients do indicate a preference for required parking
Special Requests is a right-skewed distribution
Over ½ the bookings (54%) have no special requests 
45% of the bookings have 1-2 special requests

Examining the histogram of booking status, we can make the following observations:

What we are really looking at here is the labeled net effect (Cancelled, Not Cancelled) which are contributed to by the other data features
More bookings are Not Cancelled compared to Cancelled by a ratio of roughly 2 to 1
That is a high number of cancellations that the business has to deal with
Its not clear from this graph whether that ratio is consistent across the 2 years of data, or whether an event (weather, covid, economic) affected the results one of the years which would unduely sway the results




Examining Booking Status percentages relative to overall bookings:

Roughly 70% of the bookings are successful and not cancelled
30%-ish cancellation rate is a very high rate of cancellation
The high percentage of cancellations is huge cost for the business to absorb in terms of rebooking costs
It’s not clear from the data as to how many of those cancellations end up getting successfully rebooked and at what room rate 
It would be interesting the data set included more details surrounding booking prices and rebooking percentages to more accurately understand the costs
