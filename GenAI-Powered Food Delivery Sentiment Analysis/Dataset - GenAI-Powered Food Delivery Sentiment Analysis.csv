C001,New York,28,"I'm consistently impressed with this service. Tonight, I decided to try the salmon teriyaki, and it was a fantastic choice. The fish was cooked to perfection—flaky and moist—and the teriyaki glaze was rich without being overly sweet. It was accompanied by a side of steamed vegetables that were still crisp and fresh. What really stands out is the delivery speed. The initial estimate was 40 minutes, but my meal arrived in just under 30. The driver was friendly and followed my delivery instructions to the letter. It's so refreshing to have a reliable option for a high-quality meal delivered right to my door."
C002,Los Angeles,95,"This was an absolute disaster and I will not be ordering from here again. I placed my order well in advance, scheduling it for a 7:00 PM delivery. At 7:30 PM, the app still said the order was being prepared. I called the restaurant, and they assured me it was on its way. It finally arrived at 8:15 PM, over an hour late. When I opened the bag, I discovered they had sent the completely wrong order. I received someone else's sushi when I had ordered tacos. Trying to get this resolved with customer service was a nightmare of long holds and unhelpful agents. A truly terrible experience."
C003,Chicago,58,"The experience was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the food itself was quite good. I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, and the sauce was creamy and flavorful. However, the delivery aspect was less than ideal. The app's tracker showed the driver making multiple stops before heading to my location, and the delivery took about 20 minutes longer than the latest estimated time. By the time it arrived, the pasta was lukewarm and had to be reheated, which is always a bit of a letdown. It wasn't a terrible experience, but the delay and food temperature kept it from being great."
C004,Houston,33,"This was my first time ordering, and it definitely won't be my last. I was hosting a small get-together and ordered a variety of appetizers and a couple of large pizzas. Everything arrived hot, fresh, and exactly as ordered. The 'Supreme' pizza was loaded with toppings, and the crust was perfectly crispy. Our guests couldn't stop complimenting the food. The delivery arrived right on schedule, which was crucial for our evening. The entire process, from browsing the menu on the app to the final delivery, was seamless and user-friendly. A five-star experience all around."
C005,Phoenix,26,Incredibly fast delivery! The driver was courteous and the food was amazing. A+ experience.
C006,Philadelphia,62,"My order was correct and the driver was polite, so no issues there. The delivery time was also within the window they provided. My main issue is with the food quality versus the price. I ordered a specialty sandwich that was quite expensive, and while it was okay, it didn't really live up to the description or the cost. The ingredients didn't taste particularly fresh, and the portion size was smaller than I anticipated. It was an acceptable meal, but for the price I paid, I was expecting something more impressive. It was just a very average, forgettable meal."
C007,San Antonio,40,Great food and timely delivery. The portion sizes were generous. Very satisfied.
C008,San Diego,31,"I've ordered from here several times and the quality is always top-notch. The ingredients are clearly fresh, and the chefs know what they're doing. My order always arrives hot, which is a huge plus. The delivery drivers are consistently polite and professional. It's my reliable choice for a delicious and hassle-free meal after a long day at work. I highly recommend the chicken parmesan; it's fantastic."
C009,Dallas,22,Lightning-fast delivery! The food was still steaming when it arrived. Impressive!
C010,San Jose,85,"I wish I could give zero stars. The delivery took nearly two hours. When the driver finally arrived, he was rude and just shoved the bag at me without a word. The food was, of course, stone cold. But the worst part was the quality. My burger was a greasy mess, the bun was completely soggy, and the lettuce was wilted and brown. The fries were a clump of cold, oily potato sticks. It was genuinely one of the most unappetizing meals I've ever received. I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. A complete waste of time and money."
C011,Austin,38,The quality of the food is consistently excellent. Delivery is reliable and the drivers are friendly.
C012,Jacksonville,55,"Food was okay, but the delivery was slow. It arrived later than the estimated time."

C017,Indianapolis,70,The food was cold and soggy by the time it arrived. The delivery was extremely slow.
C018,Seattle,34,"The food is always fresh and flavorful. The delivery service is top-notch. I particularly enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients in my salad, which is often a gamble with delivery. Everything was crisp and the dressing was on the side as requested. The driver followed my contact-free delivery instructions perfectly. A truly seamless and enjoyable dinner."

C023,Detroit,32,"The delivery was even earlier than the estimated time. The food was hot and delicious. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and a miso soup, and both were restaurant quality. It's rare to get sushi delivered that tastes this fresh. I appreciate the attention to detail in the packaging, which kept everything at the right temperature. Will definitely be ordering again soon."
C024,Nashville,64,"The food was decent, but I had to wait a while for the delivery. It wasn't late according to the app, but the initial estimate was quite long to begin with. The meal itself was fine, nothing to complain about but also nothing to get excited about. It served its purpose for a night when I didn't want to cook, but I'm not sure it would be my first choice next time. It was just a very standard, middle-of-the-road experience."
C025,Portland,27,Exceptional service! The food is always on point and the delivery is incredibly fast.
C026,Memphis,93,"I am beyond upset. Not only was my order an hour late, but they completely forgot one of the main entrees. I called the restaurant to let them know, and they were unhelpful and rude, telling me I had to go through the app for a refund. Now I have to wait several business days for my money back and one person in my family didn't get to eat dinner. A complete failure on all fronts. This ruined our evening."
