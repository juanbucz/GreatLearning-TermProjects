C001,New York,28,"I'm consistently impressed with this service. Tonight, I decided to try the salmon teriyaki, and it was a fantastic choice. The fish was cooked to perfection—flaky and moist—and the teriyaki glaze was rich without being overly sweet. It was accompanied by a side of steamed vegetables that were still crisp and fresh. What really stands out is the delivery speed. The initial estimate was 40 minutes, but my meal arrived in just under 30. The driver was friendly and followed my delivery instructions to the letter. It's so refreshing to have a reliable option for a high-quality meal delivered right to my door."
C002,Los Angeles,95,"This was an absolute disaster and I will not be ordering from here again. I placed my order well in advance, scheduling it for a 7:00 PM delivery. At 7:30 PM, the app still said the order was being prepared. I called the restaurant, and they assured me it was on its way. It finally arrived at 8:15 PM, over an hour late. When I opened the bag, I discovered they had sent the completely wrong order. I received someone else's sushi when I had ordered tacos. Trying to get this resolved with customer service was a nightmare of long holds and unhelpful agents. A truly terrible experience."
C003,Chicago,58,"The experience was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the food itself was quite good. I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, and the sauce was creamy and flavorful. However, the delivery aspect was less than ideal. The app's tracker showed the driver making multiple stops before heading to my location, and the delivery took about 20 minutes longer than the latest estimated time. By the time it arrived, the pasta was lukewarm and had to be reheated, which is always a bit of a letdown. It wasn't a terrible experience, but the delay and food temperature kept it from being great."
C004,Houston,33,"This was my first time ordering, and it definitely won't be my last. I was hosting a small get-together and ordered a variety of appetizers and a couple of large pizzas. Everything arrived hot, fresh, and exactly as ordered. The 'Supreme' pizza was loaded with toppings, and the crust was perfectly crispy. Our guests couldn't stop complimenting the food. The delivery arrived right on schedule, which was crucial for our evening. The entire process, from browsing the menu on the app to the final delivery, was seamless and user-friendly. A five-star experience all around."
C005,Phoenix,26,Incredibly fast delivery! The driver was courteous and the food was amazing. A+ experience.
