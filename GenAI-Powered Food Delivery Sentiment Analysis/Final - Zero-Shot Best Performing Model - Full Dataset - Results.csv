C001,New York,28,"I'm consistently impressed with this service. Tonight, I decided to try the salmon teriyaki, and it was a fantastic choice. The fish was cooked to perfection—flaky and moist—and the teriyaki glaze was rich without being overly sweet. It was accompanied by a side of steamed vegetables that were still crisp and fresh. What really stands out is the delivery speed. The initial estimate was 40 minutes, but my meal arrived in just under 30. The driver was friendly and followed my delivery instructions to the letter. It's so refreshing to have a reliable option for a high-quality meal delivered right to my door.",Positive,"Delivery Time, Food Quality, Overall Experience","Highlight quality food, fast delivery, and friendly service.",High
C002,Los Angeles,95,"This was an absolute disaster and I will not be ordering from here again. I placed my order well in advance, scheduling it for a 7:00 PM delivery. At 7:30 PM, the app still said the order was being prepared. I called the restaurant, and they assured me it was on its way. It finally arrived at 8:15 PM, over an hour late. When I opened the bag, I discovered they had sent the completely wrong order. I received someone else's sushi when I had ordered tacos. Trying to get this resolved with customer service was a nightmare of long holds and unhelpful agents. A truly terrible experience.",Negative,"Delivery Time, Packaging, Food Quality, Overall Experience","Investigate wrong order, late delivery, and customer service.",High
C003,Chicago,58,"The experience was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the food itself was quite good. I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, and the sauce was creamy and flavorful. However, the delivery aspect was less than ideal. The app's tracker showed the driver making multiple stops before heading to my location, and the delivery took about 20 minutes longer than the latest estimated time. By the time it arrived, the pasta was lukewarm and had to be reheated, which is always a bit of a letdown. It wasn't a terrible experience, but the delay and food temperature kept it from being great.",Negative,"Delivery Time, Food Quality, Overall Experience",Improve delivery tracking and food temperature maintenance.,High
C004,Houston,33,"This was my first time ordering, and it definitely won't be my last. I was hosting a small get-together and ordered a variety of appetizers and a couple of large pizzas. Everything arrived hot, fresh, and exactly as ordered. The 'Supreme' pizza was loaded with toppings, and the crust was perfectly crispy. Our guests couldn't stop complimenting the food. The delivery arrived right on schedule, which was crucial for our evening. The entire process, from browsing the menu on the app to the final delivery, was seamless and user-friendly. A five-star experience all around.",Positive,"Delivery Time, Food Quality, Overall Experience","Promote hot, fresh food and seamless ordering process.",High

C006,Philadelphia,62,"My order was correct and the driver was polite, so no issues there. The delivery time was also within the window they provided. My main issue is with the food quality versus the price. I ordered a specialty sandwich that was quite expensive, and while it was okay, it didn't really live up to the description or the cost. The ingredients didn't taste particularly fresh, and the portion size was smaller than I anticipated. It was an acceptable meal, but for the price I paid, I was expecting something more impressive. It was just a very average, forgettable meal.",Negative,"Delivery Time, Food Quality, Price, Overall Experience","Review specialty sandwich quality, portion, and price alignment.",High

C010,San Jose,85,"I wish I could give zero stars. The delivery took nearly two hours. When the driver finally arrived, he was rude and just shoved the bag at me without a word. The food was, of course, stone cold. But the worst part was the quality. My burger was a greasy mess, the bun was completely soggy, and the lettuce was wilted and brown. The fries were a clump of cold, oily potato sticks. It was genuinely one of the most unappetizing meals I've ever received. I ended up throwing most of it in the trash.

The meal itself was fine, nothing to complain about but also nothing to get excited about. It served its purpose for a night when I didn't want to cook, but I'm not sure it would be my first choice next time.

Now I have to wait several business days for my money back and one person in my family didn't get to eat dinner. A complete failure on all fronts.
